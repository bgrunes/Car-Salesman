# Description
Car Salesman allows UK citizens to find used cars for sale by make, model, year, price, transmission type, fuel type, engine size, mileage, and mpg. The program allows you to first sort the list of cars using merge sort and tim sort by year, price, and mileage to find the fastest way to sort through the list of cars. You can also specify the search by make, price, and year so that you can get a smaller list of cars printed out for you to see.
